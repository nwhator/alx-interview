# Minimum Operations

Welcome to the Minimum Operations directory! Here, you'll find a Python solution for calculating the fewest number of operations needed to result in a given number of characters in a text file.

## Task Overview

In a text file, there is a single character 'H'. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, you need to implement a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n 'H' characters in the file.

### Prototype
```python
def minOperations(n):
    pass
```

## Requirements

- `n` is an integer representing the number of 'H' characters desired in the file.
- Returns an integer representing the fewest number of operations needed.
- If n is impossible to achieve, return 0.

### Example

```python
n = 9
minOperations(n) # Output: 6
```

## Contents

- `0-minoperations.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the `minOperations` function.
- `README.md`: This readme file provides an overview of the directory and its contents.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `0x02-minimum_operations` directory.
3. Explore the `0-minoperations.py` script to understand the implementation of the `minOperations` function.
4. Execute the provided tests in the `0-main.py` file to verify the correctness of the function.

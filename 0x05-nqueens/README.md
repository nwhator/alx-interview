## Language: Python
## Weight: 1
## Project Deadline: Apr 12, 2024 6:00 AM

Welcome to the N Queens project directory! Here, you'll find a Python solution for the classic N queens problem, which involves placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard using the backtracking algorithm.

## What is the N Queens Problem?

The N queens puzzle challenges you to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Concepts Needed:
- Backtracking Algorithms: 
    - Understanding how backtracking algorithms explore all potential solutions and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
- Recursion: 
    - Utilizing recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
- List Manipulations in Python: 
    - Creating and manipulating lists to store queen positions on the chessboard.
- Python Command Line Arguments: 
    - Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.

By studying these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you'll be equipped to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python.

## Contents:
- **0-nqueens.py**: Python script containing the implementation to solve the N queens problem.
- **README.md**: This readme file provides an overview of the directory and its contents.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `0x05-nqueens` directory.
3. Explore the `0-nqueens.py` script to understand the implementation.
4. Run the script with the command `./0-nqueens.py N`, where N is an integer representing the size of the chessboard.

# Log Parsing

Welcome to the Log Parsing directory! Here, you'll find a Python solution for parsing log entries, computing metrics, and handling data streams in real-time.

## Task Overview

For the "Log Parsing" project, you'll need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (`stdin`), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data.

### Concepts Needed

To successfully complete this project, you'll need to understand and utilize the following concepts:

- File I/O in Python: Read from `sys.stdin` line by line.
- Signal Handling in Python: Handle keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling.
- Data Processing: Parse strings to extract specific data points and aggregate data to compute summaries.
- Regular Expressions: Use regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
- Dictionaries in Python: Utilize dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
- Exception Handling: Handle possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you'll be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.

## Contents

- `0-stats.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the log parsing and metrics computation.
- `README.md`: This readme file provides an overview of the directory and its contents.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `0x03-log_parsing` directory.
3. Explore the `0-stats.py` script to understand the implementation of log parsing and metrics computation.
4. Run the provided test script to verify the correctness of the `0-stats.py` script.

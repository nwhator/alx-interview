# Star Wars Characters ðŸŒŒ

Welcome to the Star Wars Characters project! In this repository, you'll find a JavaScript script that interacts with the Star Wars API to fetch and display information about characters from a specific movie based on the movie ID provided as an argument.

## Project Overview

The "0. Star Wars Characters" project requires you to utilize your knowledge of web programming, API interaction, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript to successfully retrieve and display Star Wars character names.

### Concepts Needed

To complete this project, you should be familiar with the following key concepts:

- **HTTP Requests in JavaScript**: Making HTTP requests to external services using libraries like `request` or `fetch` in Node.js.
- **Working with APIs**: Understanding RESTful APIs, parsing JSON data returned by APIs, and interacting with them in JavaScript.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Managing asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax, especially when handling API responses.
- **Command Line Arguments in Node.js**: Accessing command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script using `process.argv`.
- **Array Manipulation and Iteration**: Iterating over arrays, manipulating data structures, and formatting character names for display.

### Getting Started

To begin working on this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `0x06-starwars_api` directory.
3. Explore the `0-starwars_characters.js` script to understand its implementation.
4. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 10.x recommended).
5. Install the `request` module using npm: `npm install request`.
6. Run the script with the movie ID as a positional argument to fetch and display the characters.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command format:

```bash
./0-starwars_characters.js <movie_id>
```

Replace `<movie_id>` with the ID of the Star Wars movie you want to retrieve characters from.

Example:

```bash
./0-starwars_characters.js 3
```

This will display the characters from "Return of the Jedi" movie.

## Contribution

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any improvements, optimizations, or additional features to suggest, feel free to submit a pull request. Let's collaborate to enhance the Star Wars Characters script and make it even more functional and efficient!

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- Node.js version 10.x installed on your system.
- The `request` module installed using npm.
- Your code should follow the semistandard coding style.
- All files must be executable.

# Pascal's Triangle üìê

Welcome to the Pascal's Triangle directory! Here, you'll find Python solutions for generating Pascal's Triangle, a fascinating mathematical construct with various applications in combinatorics and number theory.

## What is Pascal's Triangle?

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers, where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top and continues infinitely downward, with each row representing the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)^n.

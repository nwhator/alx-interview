# UTF-8 Validation üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the UTF-8 Validation project! Here, you'll find a Python solution for validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. This project requires understanding of bitwise operations, the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills.

## Description

In this project, you'll implement a method in Python to determine if a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. This involves handling characters of variable byte lengths and ensuring adherence to UTF-8 encoding rules.

## Contents

- **valid_utf8.py**: Python script containing the implementation of the UTF-8 validation method.
- **README.md**: This readme file provides an overview of the project, its requirements, and tasks.

## Concepts

To successfully complete this project, you'll need to grasp the following concepts:
- Bitwise Operations in Python
- UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
- Data Representation
- List Manipulation in Python
- Boolean Logic

## Resources

To deepen your understanding of the concepts involved, consider exploring the following resources:
- [Python Bitwise Operators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators)
- [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
- [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4)
- [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)
- [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Explore the `valid_utf8.py` script to understand the implementation of UTF-8 validation.
4. Modify or extend the script as needed to enhance functionality.
5. Ensure your code follows the PEP 8 style guidelines.
6. Run the script and test its functionality with various datasets.

## Requirements

Before getting started, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- Files end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Mandatory `README.md` file at the root of the project folder
- Code should follow PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable
